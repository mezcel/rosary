## Dependency Files

#### Legacy Support Files for VS12 IDE

* VS 2017 and Oracle are phasing out support for VS2010 and older.

* I suspect VS 2012 will be in N/A soon.

* These legacy files will keep the script relevant on personal Win6-Win10 machines.

I prefer to use MySql Workbench ```mysql-workbench-community-6.3.6-winx64``` I did not enclose it, nor ```mysql-installer-community-5.7.10.0```. I have it saved offline if Oracle drops it from their DB Repo. Call me if google doesn't help.

MySql provided by WAMPP works just as well if the Oracle site changes their services in future years.

> Python aside, you absolutely need ```mysql-for-visualstudio-1.2.6.msi``` and ```mysql-connector-net-6.9.8.msi```
