This was the 2nd Development Platform build in my Rosary Series

> [Version 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLw9K8jhlSk): WinForm (Rosary + Religious Scripture / Bible Database)
* This was the best and my most prayerful version. But it was in WinForm. Its value to others would be comparable to the use of Latin in a mainstream Catholic Church. It would convey deep meaning and reverence, but nobody can use it unless they know, and value, how the Past used to work.

> [Version 2](http://mezcel.wixsite.com/rosary): WCF/WPF (Multi User Social Rosary Prayer Group)
* This version is my most Advanced version. It synchronizes multiple users as they join and exit a rosary prayer group. It is plug and play on any Wi-Fi router network. It bypasses and surpasses the limitations of the “newer and better ASP.NET. There is a chat room. The Prayer Leader or “Host Server” can change ownership to anyone active on the same prayer circle.

> [Version 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnw_XRBKW8Y&t=24s): jQuery Mobile (Stand Alone Rosary Bead Set)
* This version is my most practical. No extraordinary bells and whistles. It is the most “cross-platform” of the three. This one will actually get used and shared. Unfortunately it is the least visually appealing of the three.
