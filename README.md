# Client
Rosary App

I have not uploaded the Main Client GUI .cs code file yet

It contains the WPF and GUI functions

The Demo Version 2 Video illustrates how it looks: http://mezcel.wixsite.com/rosary/demo-video

But there is a bug that ocassionally occures when multiple Apps join together.
The bug involves people (sometimes) acting independently from each other despite the working Chat Forum
