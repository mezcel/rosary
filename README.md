# Windows.NET Rosary Prayer Community (App Development)

Developed on Visual Studio with MySql Connector ADO.NET Plugin

The Client GUI WPF is not posted yet, I still need to clean out all of the residual, unused test bench processes, hidden throughout the program.

The working Demo is complete, but the documentation write up is still under construction.

I am making a web page just to illustrate the organization and purpose of this coding project.

If your are a devloper, I recomend installing "XAML Regions" It is free from Microsoft and designed for Visual Studio 12-15 

"XAML Regions"
A small extension that adds the ability to define collapsable regions in XAML & XML code. It recognizes region definitions that are defined inside of XML comments so that code designed using this extension will have no problems compiling in environments that do not have this extension.
