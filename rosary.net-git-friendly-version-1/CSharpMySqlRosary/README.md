# Visual Studio Project Folder

**Note**: This is only a cleaned up copy of a project I resurrected from over a year ago. It is tested and it works, but it may not reflect the latest and best version of what I was working on.

##### Rosary App - Version 1 (WinForm)

* Single user experience

* ADO.NET with MySql Connector

* Must access a MySql Server.

* This version was tested on a PC which had both MySql Server and VS12 in the same machine.
