# Visual Studio Project Folder

######## Rosary App - Version 2 (WCF/WPF)

* Multiple interactive user experience
    * I am not sure, but I think it reliably supports around 8-10 users.
    * I forgot if it is the non-licensed router permissions, or if it was a Windows thing.

* ADO.NET with MySql Connector

* Must access a MySql Server

* Optional access to a router for a multi-user experience

* This version was tested on a Vista PC with WAMPP, a Win8 Tablet, and a Win10 PC, interacting together.
