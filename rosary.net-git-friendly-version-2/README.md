# Rosary App – Version 2
##### A Basic C Sharp WPF and MySql Multi-Client Tracking

* I have not touched this code for about a year since posting it. I may have modified some comments, but the structure and design is pretty much the same.

* I consolidated it to be Git friendly. The previous post was just a glorified Gist previewing key script which makes this application work.

# Windows.NET Community Rosary Prayer Group
### (App Development Example)

This is source code for VS12. You can either build and export it yourself, or you can view the [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyNlIzxZSl8) to see it in action.

This version is my most Advanced version. It synchronizes multiple users as they join and exit a rosary prayer group. It is plug and play on any Wi-Fi router network. It bypasses and surpasses the limitations of the “newer and better ASP.NET. There is a chat room. The Prayer Leader or “Host Server” can change ownership to anyone active on the same prayer circle.
* __Client-Client__ (Multiple clients can interface with each other in both ```event controls``` or with ```chat```)
* __Client-Server__ (The DB also doubles as a reliable way to synchronize even specific controls on different stages of the app's progress)
* __TCP/IP Plug/Play__ Features (Connect to a router, my app design handles the rest)

###### Links to my other Versions:

> [Version 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLw9K8jhlSk): WinForm (Rosary + Religious Scripture / Bible Database)
* This was the best and my most prayerful version. But it was in WinForm. Its value to others would be comparable to the use of Latin in a mainstream Catholic Church. It would convey deep meaning and reverence, but nobody can use it unless they know, and value, how the Past used to work.

> [Version 2](http://mezcel.wixsite.com/rosary): WCF/WPF (Multi User Social Rosary Prayer Group)
* This version is my most Advanced version. It synchronizes multiple users as they join and exit a rosary prayer group. It is plug and play on any Wi-Fi router network. It bypasses and surpasses the limitations of the “newer and better ASP.NET. There is a chat room. The Prayer Leader or “Host Server” can change ownership to anyone active on the same prayer circle.

> [Version 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnw_XRBKW8Y&t=24s): jQuery Mobile (Stand Alone Rosary Bead Set)
* This version is my most practical. No extraordinary bells and whistles. It is the most “cross-platform” of the three. This one will actually get used and shared. Unfortunately it is the least visually appealing of the three.
